# 232-v2
Test of section 232 import into database
## Problem Description
I want to download a zip archive containing several very large (~2GiB) CSV files, and post the contents of these files to a postgresql database.  The zip archive is replaced once per day, so I will run this script daily.  Because the files are so large, I canâ€™t ingest them in memory.  I only want to update the changes to each record in the database. Each CSV file represents a separate table in the database and each record has a unique primary key.

The second part of this program is to provide a RESTful interface to the database. This REST API abstracts the database implementation.

The last part of this program is to provide a simple web-based user interface that allows one to make queries against the data (for example, show me the records that have changes since yesterday).
